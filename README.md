# Advent of Code 2021 in Toit

Assuming you have built the [Open Source version of Toit](https://github.com/toitlang/toit)
you can run these with:

```
$ /path/to/checkout/build/host/sdk/bin/toitvm 1.toit
```

If you want to see how to read files in Toit, but you don't want
the actual solutions spoiled, take a look at template.toit.
